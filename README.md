## About
This is a simple server(s) that I created using Node.js. There are two versions (folders): node-server(node.js) and express-app(node.js + Express framework).
Both servers function the same way, but express-app is a little more advanced version than node-server.

## Instruction
1. Download or clone this repository into your computer by click on the "Code" tab above on the repository page.
2. Open the Powershell or Terminal and find(move to) the node-server or the express-app folder.
3. Type or copy the command `node node-server.js` for the node-server or `node app.js` for express-app, run the command.
4. After the command is executed, it will display an URL the server, and use the URL on the browser to access the server.
